### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `smith_parasite.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included dataset files `datasets` folder to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `ML-200179-Project/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook smith_parasite.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook smith_parasite.ipynb
```
or open with Juoyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
